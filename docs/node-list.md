A `NodeList` represents a fragment of HTML. It can contain one or more nodes and
the return values of its methods vary based on the count. For example getting the text
of a single h1 element via `$response->querySelector('h1')->text === "string"` will return the string
contents of that node. However, if the `NodeList` contains multiple nodes the return
will be an array such as when you get back multiple list items, `$response->querySelector('li')->text === ["list", "text", "items"]`

## expect()
You can turn any `NodeList` in to an expectation API by calling `->expect()` on it. From there
you are free to use the expectation API to assert the DOM matches your expectations.

```php
$response->querySelector('li')->expect()->count->toBe(10);
```

## getNodeOrNodes(callable $callback)
A poorly named map that either returns the result of the map on
a single node or an array of mapped values on multiple nodes.
This is called internally when you `__get` on a node list.
If `$nodeList` contains 1 node, you'll get back the text content
of that node.
```php
$textContent = $nodeList->getNodeOrNodes(fn ($node) => $node->text()); // string
```
If `$nodeList` contains 2 or more nodes, you'll get back an array
containing the text content of each node.
```php
$textContent = $nodeList->getNodeOrNodes(fn ($node) => $node->text()); // array
```

## getText()
Available as a method or a magic property of `->text`. Gets the text content of the node or nodes. This
will only return the text content of the node as well as any child nodes. Any non-text content such as
HTML tags will be removed.

## getInnerHTML()
Available as a method or a magic property of `->innerHTML`. Gets the inner HTML of the node or nodes.

## getCount()
Available via the method or a magic property of `->count` returns
the number of nodes in the node list.

## assertText($expected)
Asserts that the given string matches the text content of the node list.
Caution: if the node list contains multiple nodes then the assertion
would expect an array of strings to match.
```php
$nodeList->assertText('Hello World');
```

## assertContainsString($expected)
Asserts that the given string is a part of the node list text content
```php
$nodeList->assertContainsString('Hello');
```

## assertCount($expected)
Asserts that the given count matches the count of nodes in the node list.
```php
$nodeList->assertCount(2);
```

## dd($var = NULL)
Does a dump on the class
